## About Me
I am a first-year undergraduate student at Rutgers Business School–New Brunswick, double majoring in Computer Science and Finance, with an intended minor in Mathematics. My interests include mathematical modeling and analysis, quantitative finance, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and applied research. I have taken math courses such as linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and differential equations, and am seeking research opportunities and internships in computer science and at the intersection of math and finance.
